## 🗺️ Projects & Interactive Maps

🧭 **[Interactive NPOP Heatmap & Device Capacity Dashboard](https://github.com/KristieHu/Leaflet-Npop-Map)**  
Dynamic Excel-to-map converter showing port usage across the network. Supports CSV parsing, capacity visualization, hover/click actions, and filtering.
Visualizes network infrastructure with clustering, spiderfied markers, and search-enhanced interactivity in dashboards. 
Built with `Leaflet.js`, `PapaParse`, `XLSX.js`, `MarkerCluster`, and `OverlappingMarkerSpiderfier`.

🛰️ **[Hyperspectral Image Analytics](https://github.com/KristieHu/)**  
Work-in-progress notebooks exploring spectral signature analysis for environmental monitoring using Python and machine learning.

>  I’m driven by the power of location intelligence to bring insight and efficiency to real-world problems. Let’s connect to explore collaboration, innovation, and the future of smart geospatial solutions.

## 📍 About Me 

Hi there! I'm **Kristie Hu**, a **GIS Application Analyst**, **Network Designer**, and **Data Visualization Enthusiast** based in Toronto 🇨🇦.

With a Master’s in Geomatics from the University of Waterloo, I build bridges between technical datasets and intuitive visual experiences. Whether it’s wrangling spatial data, automating reports, or deploying web maps, my goal is always the same: **make complex insights simple and interactive** 💡.
