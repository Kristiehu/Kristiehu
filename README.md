## 📍 About Me 

Hi there! I'm **Kristie Hu**, a **GIS Application Analyst**, and **System Design Engineer**, and **Data Visualization Enthusiast** based in Toronto 🇨🇦.

I specialize in translating complex network & spatial datasets into **actionable intelligence** — from automated ETL pipelines and fibre-network analytics to interactive mapping systems.  

My work sits at the intersection of:  
- **Geospatial analytics**  
- **Data engineering & automation**  
- **Network design & infrastructure intelligence**  
- **Interactive visualization**  

I’m driven by the power of location intelligence to bring insight and efficiency to real-world problems. Let’s connect to explore collaboration, innovation, and the future of smart geospatial solutions.
