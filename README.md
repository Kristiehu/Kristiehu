## 📍 About Me 

Hi there! I'm **Kristie Hu**, a **GIS Application Analyst**, **Network Designer**, and **Data Visualization Enthusiast** based in Toronto 🇨🇦.

I specialize in translating complex network & spatial datasets into **actionable intelligence** — from automated ETL pipelines and fibre-network analytics to interactive mapping systems.  

My work sits at the intersection of:  
- **Geospatial analytics**  
- **Data engineering & automation**  
- **Network design & infrastructure intelligence**  
- **Interactive visualization**  

I’m passionate about building tools that drive clarity, reliability, and operational speed.
